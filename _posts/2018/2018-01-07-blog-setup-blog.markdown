## Introduction

This blog post links to three articles with step by step instructions for how to set up a blog with Jekyll and publishing it on GitHub.com. Only one of the posts are in this blog site, the other two use more basic layouts, and are located in separate blog sites (or GitHub repositories).

The posts include instructions for installing all applications (apps) that are needed, including the text editor <span class='app'>Atom</span> that is used for editing the special <span class='file'>.markdown</span> files required by Jekyll and GitHub.com.

## Background

 Being too busy working with different research projects (mapping natural resources), I never took the time to document neither my applications (apps) installations and setup, my own program codes, nor the architecture for how it all connects. I just tended to add more and more apps and write more complex programs, and could eventually no longer keep track of what, or how, I had done different stuff. I needed to start fresh and develop a better architecture for both the apps and the data I use, as well as for my own program codes and the data I produce. I wiped out one of mac computers, and got started. And when I began restructuring I also started this blog.

## Set up a blog with Jekyll

My first problem then suddenly became to set up a blog. I looked at different alternatives, and decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for generating the content, [GitHub](https://github.com/) for publishing, and the text editor [Atom](https://atom.io/) for writing. Also because the way Jekyll works resembles how I am used to do things: more text based and less graphical. I started out with using the default Theme that comes with Jekyll (minima), and created and wrote my very [first blog](https://karttur.github.io/setup-blog/2017/12/21/setup-blog-tools.html) about that. Because that first blog uses another Jekyll Theme, it is located in a separate GitHub repository (you will understand that if you follow what I have written about setting up a Jekyll blog at GitHub).

## Markdown editing and GitHub publication

<span class='button'>[to article](https://karttur.github.io/setup-github/index.html)</span>

Jekyll (as well as some other blog tools) use a code system called 'markdown' - a kind of intermediate between ordinary text and html codes. But markdown is much easier to understand and master compared to html. Apps like Jekyll translates the <span class='file'>.markdown</span> (or <span class='file'>.md</span>) to a <span class='file'>.html</span> file, that can then be published on the internet. For this you can choose different templates, and with the same text you can then actually choose different layouts.

But you need a text editor that assist writing <span class='file'>.md</span> files. Looking for different alternatives, I chose Atom - ‘A hackable text editor’. How to install and use Atom is described in my [first blog](https://karttur.github.io/setup-blog/2017/12/21/setup-blog-tools.html#install-atom), and then expanded a bit more in my [second blog](https://karttur.github.io/setup-github/index.html#markdown-and-layout-using-atom)

To understand the markdown coding better, I created [another Jekyll blog](https://karttur.github.io/setup-github/index.html), but this time without any template Theme. I wrote the layout myself, while borrowing some parts from the initial blog written with the Jekyll default theme minima. Also that blog is in a separate repository.

## Setting up this blog

<span class='button'>[to article](../../setup-blog/index.html)</span>

After having learnt a bit about Jekyll, GitHub and markdown, I selected the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by Michael Rose for continuing my blog. This blog post you are reading now is created using "So Simple". The main reason I chose "So Simple" is because it contained the features I was looking for, including handling mathematical equations. How I set this blog up is then described elsewhere in this blog, you can get to my "manual" [here](../../blog-setup/index.html), or from the "BLOG SETUP" in the top menu.

### More on this blogs

As I continue working on this blog, I will post new blogs, if for no other than to remember myself. To view the posts on how to set up this blog, click "BLOG" in the main menu, or [here](/blog).
